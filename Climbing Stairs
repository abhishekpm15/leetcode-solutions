You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step


CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int num1 = 0;
        int num2 = 1;
        int num3=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            num3 = num1+num2;
            num1 = num2;
            num2 = num3; 
        }
        return num3;
    }
};
